# Rubric
## Game Chosen
The chosen game has either multiple amounts of points that can be scored, as in american football, or multiple important metrics to track, such as fouls, outs, and innings in baseball.
### Udacity code reviewer comments
Perfect app for the perfect game 👍
## Overall layout
App is divided into two columns, one for each team.
### Udacity code reviewer comments
The app is designed nicely and divided properly for easy score tracking 😍👌
## Column contents
Each column contains a large TextView to keep track of the current score for that team.
Optionally, a second TextView to track another important metric such as fouls can be added.
## Score buttons
Each column contains multiple buttons. The buttons must track either:
* Each track a different kind of scoring
Or
* Each track a different metric (one score, the other fouls, for instance).
## Reset button
The layout contains a ‘reset’ button.
### Udacity code reviewer comments
Great work, The reset button works flawlessly 👍
## Best practices
The code adheres to all of the following best practices:
* Text sizes are defined in sp
* Lengths are defined in dp
* Padding and margin is used appropriately, such that the views are not crammed up against each other.

# Code Readability
## Naming conventions
* Any classes are named after the object they represent. All variables are named by their intended contents.
* All methods are named by their intended effect or in the style required by a callback interface.
## Code style
* There are no unnecessary blank lines. One variable is declared per declaration line.
* The code within a method is indented with respect to the method declaration line.
